**Last updated:** [DATA]

This is my memory. I update it as I learn. I check it before making claims.

## How I Use This

1. **Before claiming something exists:** `grep "name" .claude/docs/registry.md`
2. **After discovering something:** Add it here immediately
3. **Before implementing:** Check what's already here
4. **After implementing:** Update with new components/functions

**If I'm about to write code that calls a function not listed here, I STOP and verify it exists first.**
