# Landing Page Generation Prompt

## Pre-Generation Questions

### Required
1. **Product/Service**: What are you selling/offering?
2. **Primary CTA**: What action should visitors take? (buy, signup, demo, contact)
3. **Target audience**: Who is this for? (demographics, pain points, awareness level)
4. **Key differentiator**: Why choose this over alternatives?

### Optional
5. **Price point**: (affects copy strategy - high ticket vs impulse buy)
6. **Social proof available**: Reviews, testimonials, logos, numbers?
7. **Objections to address**: Common hesitations?
8. **Tone**: (default: confident, benefit-focused)
9. **Urgency elements**: Limited time/quantity? (use only if genuine)

## Generation Template (Above the Fold)

```markdown
# [HEADLINE: Primary benefit + target audience clarity]
## [SUBHEADLINE: Expand on how, or address key objection]

[Hero paragraph: 2-3 sentences. Problem → Solution → Outcome.
Be specific. "Save 10 hours/week" beats "Save time".]

[PRIMARY CTA BUTTON: Action verb + benefit. "Start Free Trial" not "Submit"]

[Trust signal: "Trusted by 10,000+ teams" or "No credit card required"]
```

## Generation Template (Body)

```markdown
## [Problem Section Header - Agitate the pain]

[Describe the current painful state. Be specific and empathetic.
Use "you" language. Make them feel understood.]

- Pain point 1 with emotional weight
- Pain point 2 with specific scenario
- Pain point 3 with consequences

## [Solution Section Header - Present the transformation]

[Introduce your product as the bridge from pain to desired state.
Focus on outcomes, not features.]

### [Feature 1 → Benefit]
[What it does → What they get. Always connect to their life/work.]

### [Feature 2 → Benefit]
[Same pattern. Specific > Vague.]

### [Feature 3 → Benefit]
[Same pattern.]

## [Social Proof Section]

> "[Testimonial that addresses key objection or confirms key benefit]"
> — **Name**, Title at Company

[Or: Logos of recognizable customers]
[Or: "[X] customers served" with specific number]

## [Objection Handling / FAQ]

**[Common objection as question]?**
[Direct answer that reframes or resolves]

**[Another objection]?**
[Direct answer]

## [Final CTA Section]

### [Restate core value proposition]

[Final persuasive paragraph. Summarize transformation.
Create urgency only if genuine.]

[PRIMARY CTA BUTTON - Same as above]

[Risk reversal: "30-day money-back guarantee" or "Cancel anytime"]
```
