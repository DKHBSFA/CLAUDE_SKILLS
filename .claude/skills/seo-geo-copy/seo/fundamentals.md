# SEO Fundamentals

## What is SEO?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing digital content to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs), driving organic (non-paid) traffic to websites.

## The Three Pillars of SEO

### 1. Technical SEO

The foundation that ensures search engines can crawl, render, and index your content.

**Key Components:**
- Site architecture and URL structure
- Crawlability (robots.txt, internal linking)
- Indexability (canonical tags, noindex directives)
- Page speed and Core Web Vitals
- Mobile-friendliness
- HTTPS security
- Structured data (Schema.org)

### 2. On-Page SEO

Optimization of individual pages to rank for target keywords.

**Key Components:**
- Title tags and meta descriptions
- Header hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Content quality and relevance
- Keyword placement and density
- Internal linking
- Image optimization (alt text, compression)
- URL optimization

### 3. Off-Page SEO

Building authority through external signals.

**Key Components:**
- Backlink acquisition
- Brand mentions (linked and unlinked)
- Social signals
- Local SEO (Google Business Profile)

## Search Intent: The Foundation of Strategy

### The Four Types of Search Intent

| Intent | User Goal | Content Type | Example Query |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Informational** | Learn something | Blog posts, guides, tutorials | "how to tie a tie" |
| **Navigational** | Find a specific site | Homepage, login pages | "gmail login" |
| **Commercial** | Research before buying | Reviews, comparisons | "best running shoes 2026" |
| **Transactional** | Make a purchase | Product pages, pricing | "buy nike air max" |

### Matching Content to Intent

**Critical Rule**: The top-ranking pages reveal the dominant intent. If all top 10 results are blog posts, Google has determined the intent is informational—don't try to rank a product page.

**Analysis Process:**
1. Search your target keyword
2. Analyze the top 10 results
3. Identify the dominant content type
4. Note common elements (word count, format, topics covered)
5. Create content that matches or exceeds the pattern

## Keyword Research Methodology

### Step 1: Seed Keywords

Start with broad terms related to your topic/business:
- Your products/services
- Problems you solve
- Questions customers ask
- Competitor analysis

### Step 2: Keyword Expansion

Use tools to expand seeds into comprehensive lists:

**Tools:**
- Google Keyword Planner (free with Google Ads account)
- Semrush Keyword Magic Tool
- Ahrefs Keywords Explorer
- Ubersuggest
- AnswerThePublic (question-based keywords)

**Expansion Methods:**
- Related keywords
- Long-tail variations
- Question queries (how, what, why, when, where)
- Modifier additions (best, top, cheap, vs, review)

### Step 3: Keyword Metrics Evaluation

| Metric | Description | Ideal for New Sites |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Search Volume** | Monthly searches | 100-1,000 |
| **Keyword Difficulty** | Competition level (0-100) | <40 |
| **CPC** | Paid search cost (indicates commercial value) | Higher = more valuable |
| **SERP Features** | Featured snippets, PAA, etc. | Opportunities to capture |

### Step 4: Keyword Prioritization Matrix

```
                    High Volume
                         │
         Quick Wins      │    Primary Targets
         (Medium KD,     │    (Low KD, High Volume)
          High Volume)   │
                         │
    ─────────────────────┼─────────────────────
                         │
         Low Priority    │    Foundation
         (High KD,       │    (Low KD, Low Volume)
          Low Volume)    │
                         │
                    Low Volume
```

**Strategy by Site Maturity:**
- **New sites**: Focus on Foundation + Quick Wins
- **Established sites**: Target Primary Targets + Quick Wins
- **Authority sites**: Can tackle High KD keywords

## SEO Myths to Avoid

### Myth 1: Keyword Density Matters

**Reality**: There is no optimal keyword density. Write naturally. Google understands synonyms and context.

### Myth 2: Meta Keywords Tag Works

**Reality**: Google has ignored the meta keywords tag since 2009. Don't waste time on it.

### Myth 3: More Pages = Better Rankings

**Reality**: Quality over quantity. 10 excellent pages outperform 100 thin pages.

### Myth 4: Backlinks Are All That Matter

**Reality**: Backlinks are one factor among hundreds. Content quality, user experience, and relevance matter equally.

### Myth 5: SEO Is a One-Time Task

**Reality**: SEO is ongoing. Algorithms change, competitors improve, content ages.

### Myth 6: Exact Match Domains Boost Rankings

**Reality**: Minimal if any benefit. Brand-focused domains are better long-term.

## Algorithm Updates: What Matters

### Major Google Updates to Know

| Update | Focus | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Panda** (2011) | Content quality | Penalized thin/duplicate content |
| **Penguin** (2012) | Link spam | Penalized manipulative links |
| **Hummingbird** (2013) | Semantic search | Better understanding of intent |
| **Mobile-Friendly** (2015) | Mobile UX | Mobile-first consideration |

| **Helpful Content** (2022+) | People-first content | Penalizes SEO-first content |
| **AI Content** (2023+) | Content authenticity | Focus on E-E-A-T |

### Surviving Algorithm Updates

1. **Focus on users, not algorithms**: Helpful content always wins long-term
2. **Diversify traffic sources**: Don't depend 100% on Google
3. **Build real authority**: Genuine expertise is hard to devalue
4. **Monitor core updates**: Know when rankings shift isn't your fault
5. **Avoid shortcuts**: What works temporarily often fails spectacularly
