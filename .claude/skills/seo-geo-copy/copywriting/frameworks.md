# Copywriting Frameworks

## What is Copywriting?

Copywriting is the art and science of writing text that persuades readers to take a specific action—whether that's buying a product, signing up for a newsletter, or simply continuing to read.

**Key distinction:**
- **Content writing**: Informs and educates
- **Copywriting**: Persuades and converts

In practice, the best content does both.

## The Psychology of Persuasion

Before frameworks, understand the principles (based on Robert Cialdini's research):

### 1. Reciprocity

People feel obligated to return favors.

**Application**: Give value first. Free guides, tools, and insights create goodwill.

### 2. Commitment & Consistency

Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent.

**Application**: Start with small asks. "Download the free guide" → "Join the webinar" → "Book a demo"

### 3. Social Proof

People look to others' behavior to guide their own.

**Application**: Testimonials, case studies, user counts, reviews.

### 4. Authority

People respect and follow credible experts.

**Application**: Credentials, certifications, media mentions, expert endorsements.

### 5. Liking

People are more easily persuaded by those they like.

**Application**: Show personality, share values, be relatable.

### 6. Scarcity

Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Application**: Limited-time offers, exclusive access, countdown timers.

## Framework 1: AIDA

**Attention → Interest → Desire → Action**

The classic advertising framework, still effective for digital content.

### Attention

Capture attention immediately. You have 2-3 seconds.

**Techniques:**
- Bold, benefit-driven headlines
- Surprising statistics
- Provocative questions
- Pattern interrupts

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Welcome to Our Website"
✅ "Stop Losing 40% of Your Visitors to Slow Pages"

❌ "Our SEO Services"
✅ "We Ranked #1 for 847 Keywords Last Year. Here's How."
```

### Interest

Build interest by connecting with the reader's situation.

**Techniques:**
- Identify their problem
- Show you understand their pain
- Hint at a solution
- Use storytelling

**Example:**
```
You've tried everything. Keyword research, backlink building,
content optimization. Yet your competitors still outrank you.
The traffic that should be yours is going to them—along with
the revenue.

It's not your effort that's the problem. It's the approach.
```

### Desire

Transform interest into desire by showing benefits.

**Techniques:**
- Benefits, not features
- Paint the after-state
- Provide social proof
- Address objections

**Example:**
```
Imagine logging into Analytics and seeing your traffic graph
going up—not just by 10%, but by 312% like our client TechCorp.

Our clients typically see:
• 3x organic traffic within 6 months
• 47% increase in qualified leads
• $4.50 return for every $1 invested

"We were skeptical at first. Now SEO drives 60% of our revenue."
— Sarah Chen, CMO at TechCorp
```

### Action

Tell them exactly what to do next.

**Techniques:**
- Clear, specific CTA
- Create urgency (when genuine)
- Reduce friction
- Reinforce value

**Example:**
```

In 24 hours, you'll know exactly what's holding your site back—

## Framework 2: PAS

**Problem → Agitate → Solution**

Powerful for sales pages and problem-focused content.

### Problem

Identify the specific problem your audience faces.

**Techniques:**
- Be specific, not generic
- Use their language
- Show you understand
- Focus on one problem

**Example:**
```
You're publishing content every week. Good content.
Researched, edited, optimized.

But the traffic isn't coming.

Your competitors—with worse content—still rank above you.
```

### Agitate

Amplify the emotional impact of the problem.

**Techniques:**
- Explore consequences
- Future-pace the pain
- Make it visceral
- Don't overdo it (authentic, not manipulative)

**Example:**
```
Every month that passes, you're losing ground.

While you're stuck on page 3, your competitors are capturing
the customers who should be yours. They're building the brand
recognition. They're earning the backlinks. They're compounding
their advantage.

In 6 months, the gap won't be just rankings. It'll be market share.

And once they're established as the authority? Catching up becomes
ten times harder.
```

### Solution

Present your solution as the answer.

**Techniques:**
- Clear connection to the problem
- Specific mechanism (how it works)
- Proof it works
- Easy next step

**Example:**
```
What if you could skip the guesswork?

Our Technical SEO Audit identifies the exact issues blocking
your rankings—in 24 hours.

implementation guides.

## Framework 3: BAB

**Before → After → Bridge**

Excellent for transformation-focused messaging.

### Before

Paint the current painful state.

**Example:**
```
Right now, creating content feels like shouting into a void.

You spend hours researching, writing, editing. You hit publish.
And... nothing. A trickle of traffic. No engagement. No leads.

The ROI on your content investment? Embarrassing to calculate.
```

### After

Paint the desired future state.

**Example:**
```
Imagine a different reality.

Every piece of content you publish climbs the rankings.
Traffic grows month over month—predictably. Your sales team
has more qualified leads than they can handle. And you?
You're seen as the authority in your space.

Content isn't a cost center anymore. It's your growth engine.
```

### Bridge

Show how your solution gets them from Before to After.

**Example:**
```
The bridge between these two realities is a content strategy
built on data, not guesswork.

Our Content Acceleration Program gives you:
• Keyword research based on actual ranking potential
• Content briefs reverse-engineered from top performers
• Monthly optimization passes to improve existing content
• Direct access to strategists who've done this 100+ times

In 90 days, you'll have a content machine—not a content graveyard.

### Promise

Make a bold, specific promise.

**Example:**

you did it. Your CEO is finally impressed with marketing.

That's not a fantasy. It's what happens when you stop
guessing and start executing a proven system.
```

### Proof

Back up your promise with evidence.

**Example:**
```
We've done this 347 times.
