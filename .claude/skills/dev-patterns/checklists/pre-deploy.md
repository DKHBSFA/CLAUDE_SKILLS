- [ ] On-call aware of changes
- [ ] Support team briefed (if user-facing changes)

### External (if applicable)

- [ ] Status page updated
- [ ] Documentation published

---

## Deploy Process

### Pre-Deploy
```
1. [ ] Pull latest from main branch
2. [ ] Run full test suite
3. [ ] Build production artifacts
4. [ ] Tag release version
```

### Deploy
```
1. [ ] Deploy to staging first
2. [ ] Verify staging
3. [ ] Deploy to production (canary if available)
4. [ ] Monitor initial traffic
```

### Post-Deploy
```
1. [ ] Verify health checks
2. [ ] Check error rates
3. [ ] Verify key flows manually
4. [ ] Monitor for 15-30 minutes
5. [ ] Confirm success or rollback
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### Triggers for Rollback
- Error rate > X% (define threshold)
- Key functionality broken
- Security issue discovered
- Performance degradation > Y%

### Rollback Steps
```
1. [ ] Identify issue
2. [ ] Notify team
3. [ ] Execute rollback
4. [ ] Verify rollback successful
5. [ ] Communicate status
6. [ ] Post-mortem scheduled
```

---

## Environment-Specific

### Staging
- [ ] Mirrors production config
- [ ] Has production-like data (sanitized)
- [ ] All integrations connected

### Production
- [ ] Final verification complete
- [ ] Deployment window confirmed
- [ ] Emergency contacts available

---

## Quick Reference

### Go/No-Go Criteria
